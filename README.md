# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to help Martha, a senior manager at Accountability Accounting, with grouping cryptocurrencies. Acountability Accounting is a large investment bank that is considering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. Ideally the vast universe of cryptocurrencies will be broken into several groupings that represent different investment strategies. This project is a large undertaking and will require multiple iterations of data mining, clustering, and business meetings before a final decision on offerings can be made. The following code represents the first iteration in this process. 

The data provided is not ideal so processing the data is significant in order to fit machine learning models. After processing, the data is grouped using an unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithm. Interactive visualizations are provided within the code. The project is ready for review with the Advisory Services Team before sharing with the company board.

The code for analysis can be found [here.](challenge/crypto_clustering.ipynb)
